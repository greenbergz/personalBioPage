                <h2> Studies</h2>
                <p>I am currentlly a sophomore at Washington University in St.Louis studying computer science and economics</p>
                <p>  I have been working with programming since I was a sophomore in high school. My senior year of high school I started working in robotics by working with  VEX robots. I had to get my specific robot to use its claw to lift up a cup. It used sensors to follow a path mapped out by black tape. Eventually we moved on to quad-copters and got them to fly.</p>
                <p> Since coming to college I have worked on several projects such as a bouncing balls physics simulator, and a picture of a flower using recursive design. In my sophomore year I started working with an Arduino board to work with two processors at once. I have used various sensors on the board to get it to act like a fit bit, a morse code translator, and a temperature sensor.</p>
                <p> I have also been studying economics for three years and it is another area which I am deeply interested in. In my studies of economics I have written papers about  why NASA is loosing funding and why they are not able to continue their work a strongly as they once were able to. I have also worked a little bit with game theory, such as the prisoners dilemma.</p>
                <p> I studied latin and roman history for seven years and used to be a member of the Latin Junior Classical League. Having studied latin for so long I have been able to pick up other romance languages relatively quicker due to the fact that a lot of the roots of those words are based in latin as well as the way sentence structure works.</p>

                <h2> Interests</h2>
                <p>Outside of school I am very interested in reading science fiction and fantasy. I also enjoy browsing imgur and watching netflix. </p>
                <p> I am currently reading the foundation series by Isaac Asimov, but my favorite book series by far is the Harry Potter series. I read and reread those books a countless number of times. So much so that I know exactly when the movies start to stray off from the path of the book.</p>
                <p> I am an avid fan of cloud watching( where you go outside and just look up at some clouds). I love cloud watching because I like to see how different people interpret different shapes and what they think it looks like. I also just really enjoy being outside in the nice weather and looking at clouds</p>

                <h2> About Me</h2>

                <p> I am from New York City and have lived there for my entire life until now. I live with my mom, dad, brother, and sister. I am from Manhattan but I went to high school in the Bronx. I used to have to travel about an hour each way to school and back.</p>
                <p> In high school  I ran Cross Country, Indoor, and Outdoor track for four years, and was the captain of the team my last year. While running cross country I managed to run my best 5 K race ever at a time of 19 minutes and 50 seconds. The toughest part about doing an after school activity was the fact that I would get home very late due to the long travel time between my home and school. Below is a link to my athelete profile</p>

                </li>
                <p> When I was a sophomore in high school my family adopted a cat. Adopting the cat was great because I had never had a pet before. The only problem was that it turns out I am heavily allergic to cats and so I have had to take allergy pills every day since I found out. A year later, my brother came back from college with a cat of his own. This one stayed in our room while my brother was home and so no matter what I did I was always having an allergic reaction.</p>
                <p> Despite the fact that I live with two cats I still like dogs better. My family's cat is the white one, and my brother's cat is the black one.</p>
